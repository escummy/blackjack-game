# Contributing

Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [pull requests](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)

If you don't see your idea listed or to improve something, you can feel free to send a pull request.

## Workflow

Repositories use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), so all code changes happen through pull requests. In summary, if you want to contribute to a project, the simplest way is, after clone the repository:

<br>

- Create a branch

Create a branch in your repository, a space to work without affecting the default branch.

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

<br>

- Make changes

Your branch is a safe place to make changes. If you make a mistake, your changes will not end up on the default branch until you merge your branch.

<br>

- Commit and push

Commit and push changes to your branch until you are ready to ask for feedback.

<br>

- Create a pull request

Create a pull request to ask collaborators for feedback on your changes, include a summary of the changes and what problem they solve.

> --> Click on 'Compare & pull request'
>
> --> Click on 'Create pull request' to serve the changes

<br>

- Address review comments

Reviewers can comment on the whole pull request or add comments to specific lines. You can continue to commit and push changes in response to the reviews.

<br>

- Merge your pull request

Once your pull request is approved, merge your pull request. This will automatically merge your branch so that your changes appear on the default branch.

<br>

- Delete your branch

After you merge your pull request, delete your branch. This indicates that the work on the branch is complete and prevents you or others from accidentally using old branches.
